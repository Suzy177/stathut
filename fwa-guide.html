  <h1>How Farm War Alliance (FWA) Works</h1>
  <p>
    A beginner-friendly guide to understanding FWA wars in Clash of Clans
    and how StatHut helps players farm smarter.

    <h3>What is FWA?</h3>
    <p>
      Farm War Alliance (FWA) is a system where clans coordinate wars to maximize
      loot and upgrades instead of competitive war performance. Wins are planned,
      attacks are controlled, and players benefit from guaranteed resources.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How Do FWA Wars Work?</h3>
    <p>
      FWA clans are matched against other FWA clans. Both sides agree on base layouts
      and attack rules. One clan wins, the other loses, and the result alternates
      in future wars to keep things fair.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why Do FWA Bases Look Strange?</h3>
    <p>
      Bases are intentionally designed to allow easy attacks. This ensures everyone
      completes their attacks and gains maximum loot without unnecessary stress
      or failed attempts.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>What Are the Rules?</h3>
    <p>
      • Follow assigned targets<br>
      • Use approved base layouts<br>
      • Complete all war attacks<br>
      • No freestyle or trophy pushing in war<br>
      • Respect clan coordination
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Is FWA Safe?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. FWA operates within Clash of Clans mechanics and has been used safely
      by organized clans for years when rules are followed correctly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why Join an FWA Clan?</h3>
    <p>
      FWA is ideal for players upgrading heroes, walls, and defenses. You get
      consistent loot, predictable wars, and a relaxed environment focused
      on long-term progression.
