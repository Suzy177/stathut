  <h1>How Farm War Alliance (FWA) Works</h1>
  <p>
    A beginner-friendly guide to understanding FWA wars in Clash of Clans
    and how StatHut helps players farm smarter.

    <h3>What is FWA?</h3>
    <p>
      Farm War Alliance (FWA) is a system where clans coordinate wars to
      maximize loot and upgrades instead of competitive war performance.
      Wins are planned, attacks are controlled, and players benefit from
      guaranteed resources.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How Do FWA Wars Work?</h3>
    <p>
      FWA clans are matched against other FWA clans. Both sides agree on
      base layouts and attack rules. One clan wins, the other loses, and
      the result alternates in future wars to keep things fair.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why Do FWA Bases Look Strange?</h3>
    <p>
      Bases are intentionally designed to allow easy attacks. This ensures
      everyone completes their attacks and gains maximum loot without
      unnecessary stress or failed attempts.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>What Are the Rules?</h3>
    <p>
      • Follow assigned targets<br>
      • Use approved base layouts<br>
      • Complete all war attacks<br>
      • Do not freestyle or trophy push in war<br>
      • Respect clan coordination
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Is FWA Safe?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. FWA operates within Clash of Clans mechanics and has been used
      by thousands of clans for years. As long as rules are followed,
      players benefit without account risk.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why Join an FWA Clan?</h3>
    <p>
      FWA is ideal for players upgrading heroes, walls, and defenses.
      You get consistent loot, predictable wars, and a relaxed environment
      focused on progression.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How StatHut Manages FWA</h3>
    <p>
      StatHut maintains organized clans, clear communication, and proper
      coordination to ensure smooth FWA wars. Players are guided through
      rules, placement, and expectations.
