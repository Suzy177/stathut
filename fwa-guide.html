  <h2>What is FWA?</h2>
  <p>
    Farm War Alliance (FWA) is a coordinated war system where clans
    intentionally plan wars to maximize loot and upgrades instead of
    competitive performance.
  </p>

  <h2>How Do FWA Wars Work?</h2>
  <p>
    Clans matched against each other agree on base layouts and attack rules.
    One clan wins, the other loses, and the result alternates in future wars
    to keep things fair.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Choose FWA?</h2>
  <p>
    FWA wars allow players to safely complete attacks, gain maximum loot,
    and upgrade heroes without pressure or stress.
  </p>

  <h2>What Are the Rules?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow assigned targets</li>
    <li>Use approved base layouts</li>
    <li>Complete all war attacks</li>
    <li>No unnecessary triple pushing</li>
    <li>Respect coordination rules</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Is FWA Safe?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. FWA operates within Clash of Clans mechanics and has been used
    safely by organized clans for years when rules are followed.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Join an FWA Clan?</h2>
  <p>
    FWA is ideal for players upgrading heroes, walls, and defenses who
    want consistent loot and a relaxed environment focused on long-term
    progression.
  </p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    used by thousands of clans.

  <h3>Can rushed accounts join?</h3>

    Some clans accept rushed bases for farming, while others require
    balanced progression.
  </p>

  <h3>Do I need to attack in every war?</h3>

    beneficial for everyone.
